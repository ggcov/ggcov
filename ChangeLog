	* Release 0.10
	* Support for every GCC release up to 10.0
	* Support binutils up to 2.34
	* Add gccov-html which generates a static HTML coverage report
	  (entirely separate from the PHP-based "ggcov-web" support).
	* Support C++ source filenames ending in ".c++"
	* Reimplemented runtime logging and commandline argument parsing
	* Fix update of flow diagram in the Source window
	* Improve accounting for Function and Overall scopes
	* Merge in most of the Debian/Ubuntu package patches
	* Removed various code smells like static variables, singletons,
	  friend declarations, and ancient integer typedefs.
	* Multiple improvements to build and unit tests.

Thu Mar 13 07:44:17 2014  Greg Banks <gnb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.9

	* Handle gcc 4.7 (generic)
	* Update RPM spec to distribute ggcov-run
	* Work around bfd dynamic library linking issues on Ubuntu
	* Support call scanning on x86-64.
	* Work around a gcc/bfd filename bug with yacc files

	* Find object files with a .os extension
	* Find .gcda files buried in libtool .libs/ dirs
	* Don't recurse into toplevel debian/ or .git/ directories

	* Automatically suppress blocks which call abort() and blocks
	which represent the failure case of assert() statements; now
	your assert() statements don't drag down the coverage stats.
	* Add the --suppress-call option to allow you to suppress
	any block which calls a given function.

	* Remember various user interface state between ggcov runs:
	window size and position, checkboxes in menus, Source window
	column state.
	* Lists of files now trees with filename and directory icons.
	* Update several windows to use the newer GtkComboBox widget.
	* Tooltips on flow diagram show block info and suppressions

	* Make the Summary text columns fixed width so the window
	doesn't resize unexpectedly.
	* Fix scroll preservation on the Source window
	* Grey out menu items in the Source window
	* Show abbreviated common path in Files window
	* Improved error message for missing files, bogus tags.
	* Minor performance improvements
	* Improvements to data structures, code, build and unit tests.

Sun Jul 24 13:59:04 2011  Greg Banks <gnb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.8.4

	* Add the ggcov-run program, which can be used to run a test program in
	such a way that the runtime generated coverage data files are stored in
	a chosen location rather than being written to the source directory.
	Added corresponding --gcda-prefix option to ggcov, tggcov and
	git-history-coverage.  This feature is useful for those testing
	scenarios where the source directory is not available or not writable.

	* Reorganise compiler version handling to make it easier to add support
	for new compiler versions, especially ones that are identical in
	behaviour to gcc 4.0 except for the reported version string.  Also some
	code cleanliness improvements including const correctness and fixing
	compile warnings with newer versions of gcc.
	* Support for gcc 4.6, including:
	 - gcc 4.6.x in Ubuntu Oneiric -- thanks to Jim Huang.
	 - gcc 4.6(prelease) in Debian Wheezy.

	* Usability improvements:
	 - tggcov will annotate yacc and lex input files
	 - don't complain about source filename "<stdout>"
	 - fuzzy function solving is always enabled

	 - turn off compiledir warnings entirely
	 - handle filename clashes with yacc-produced .c
	 - detect more recent compiler millicode functions
	 - handle un-normalised source filenames in .gcno
	 - useful errors when detecting that data files were produced by an
	   unrecognised compiler version.

	* Improve .gitignore -- thanks to Jim Huang.
	* Some improvements to utility classes
	* Better errors when tggcov fails in tests
	* Use --coverage option in testing.
	* Fix racy loop in test015 make check due to UMR

Fri Apr 22 16:39:00 2011  Greg Banks <gnb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.8.3

	* Handle gcc 4.5.

	* Silently treat missing .gcda files as zero counts
	* Automatically suppress some glibc inline functions
	* Split ggcov RPM packages into three.
	* Fix a really old bug with minimal_name()
	* Add hashtable_iter_t to iterate a hashtable

	* Fix dist: target again
	* Modernise RPC spec file.
	* Use PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in configure.in
	* Converted .cvsignore files to .gitignore
	* Use git to generate ChangeLog not CVS.

Sun May  9 15:55:03 2010  Greg Banks <gnb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.8.2

	* Support for gcc 4.4.1 (Ubuntu 9.10), patch from Ken McDonell.
	* Removed the ability to read files produced by gcc -db.  This
	feature was always too fragile as it depended too closely on
	undocumented and volatile gcc internals.  Removed test018
	which exercised this feature and has been broken for some time.
	* Char* constness fixes from Ken McDonell.
	* Other minor compilation fixes.
	* Fixed a number of complaints from automake 1.11 about gmake
	specific features in Makefile.am files.
	* Update CVS ignore files.
	* Update my email address.
	* Update the release procedure document.
	* Fix wrong test name in test022 error message
	* Improve the existing estring unit test and add test023 to
	actually run it for "make check".

Fri Jan  8 19:29:58 2010  Greg Banks <gnb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.8.1

	* Support gcc 4.3 file formats.
	* Fix various compile warnings.
	* Make test 018 failure message clearer.

Sun Jul  2 19:04:17 2006  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.8

	* Significant improvements to the callgraph diagram layout algorithm,
	which now generates more visually pleasing results for a wider range
	of possible callgraphs.
	* When mousing over callgraph nodes in the gtk gui, show a popup
	containing the same information as the node box but actually large
	enough to be visible on nontrivial diagrams.
	* Add to the gtk gui a -w option to specify window(s) to open initially.
	* Support file format from gcc 3.4 on Mandrake 10.2.
	* Handle gcc 4.1.1 data file formats.
	* Handle file format from the gcc 4.0.3 in Ubuntu Dapper.
	* Patch by Jim Huang to support gcc 3.4 and gcc 4.1 on Ubuntu.
	* Automatically detect when ggcov is being run from it's source
	directory and adjust the libglade search path to find the
	uninstalled glade file first.  This avoids the need to build
	with UI_DEBUG=1 in order to run ggcov before install.
	* Reduce memory usage in various ways, including keeping some
	strings uniquely in a hashtable, and using u64 instead of string
	for gcc4.0 function id.
	* Don't rely on the build system providing -Wl,--export-dynamic for
	libglade to work after the ggcov executable is stripped, instead
	use a Perl script to generate a C array which maps names to function
	pointers.  This is needed for Ubuntu, and also makes the exe smaller.
	* Centralise the common parts of commandline option processing and
	interpretation in cov.C.  Instead of one `recursive' flag in each
	source file containing a main(), there's now exactly one.
	* Combine "graph2win" and "legowin" into "diagwin"
	* Rationalise debug tokens.
	* Reorganise covio_t code.
	* Centralise the dbounds_t structure and some defines in a new header.
	Move various code from the callgraph diagram to methods of dbounds_t.
	* Add a scene generator which generates no output but performs various
	geometrical checks for poor diagram layout; particularly useful for
	objective testing of the callgraph diagram layout code.
	* Add a --dump-callgraph option to tggcov to dump the callgraph in an
	ASCII form suitable for checking in tests.
	* Add test 15, which exercises the callgraph diagram layout algorithm
	using a Perl script to generate C code from simple graph descriptions.
	* Running a runtest script with ENABLE_DB_FLAG in the enviroment will
	enable the -db gcc flag, generating a foo.c.12.bp file.
	* Add test018 which exercises the 12bp callgraph reading code.
	* Fix logic bug: when accounting coverage status of branches,
	branches cannot ever be partially covered.
	* Fixed compile warnings from gcc 4.1.1.
	* Don't complain about R_386_GOT32 relocs in i386 code.
	* Fix an invalid free in test018 (thanks to Jim Huang for the report)
	* Callgraph handles calls to functions with attribute(pure)
	* Improve filtering of line coverage results in test cases, to avoid
	spurious test failures due to differing algorithms for counting
	multi-block lines (the for(;;) problem) and for lone "catch" statements.

Mon Sep 12 00:21:42 2005  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.7

	* Handle the gcc 4.0.0 and Fedora Core 4 compiler file formats.
	* Add suppress by comment.  New -Y commandline option allows
	suppressing source lines with a single-line comment containing
	the specified word.  New -Z option suppresses a range of lines
	starting and ending with the given words.
	* Rejig block graph solving algorithm to handle calls to functions
	which return a different number of times than they're called, such
	as exit() or fork() or any function which might eventually call
	longjmp().
	* Source files in /usr/include and /usr/lib are not counted towards
	the common path for source files.
	* Handle relative paths to source files in .gcno and .o files.
	* Handle compiling with version 3 of DB, found on some distros.
	* Handle calls to functions marked with attribute((pure)) gracefully.
	* Remove the unhelpful Arc column from the Calls window
	* Remove the long-redundant HAVE_BBG_FAKE_FLAG define and all the code
	that depended on it.

	* Fix compile warnings from gcc 4.0.0.
	* Fix memory buffer addressing bugs in the code to scan i386 object
	files for call graph information.
	* Fix assert failure when built against GTK2 library and the
	^W accelerator to close a window is used before the File menu
	is manually shown.
	* Don't complain about R_386_GOT32 relocs in i386 code.
	* Fix a Free Memory Read found when trying coverage samba4 code.
	* Fix a corner case in the formatting of block lists.
	* Add --version options to tggcov and ggcov-webdb (ggcov itself already
	has this option via GNOME's popt table).
	* When built against recent libgnome, ggcov's --help output failed to
	describe the ggcov-specific options.  Fix this by pushing the popt
	options table to gnome_program_init().

	* Fix ambiguity in function's file scope on summary page.
	* Hyperlinks to source page use URLs cleaned of extraneous query
	strings.
	* Change the View links on the summary page to buttons, so they
	  show the right page without clicking Update first.
	* Make web interface windows 100% wide.
	* Web interface handles missing or empty tests dir more gracefully.

	* Add --disable-web option to configure
	* Enforce --disable-gui more strictly
	* Remove a superfluous AC_ARG_PROGRAM, as AM_INIT calls it too.
	* Handle quirks of older automakes.

	* Loosen expected file comparison test to ignore line counts for
	function variable lines, to avoid pointless compiler variation
	in tests.
	* Convert test007 to use expected output rather than compare to gcov
	output, which miscounts the block which checks the return of setjmp().
	* Add test016 to configure.in

Sun Jun 19 17:09:27 2005  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.6 (big jump reflects lots of changes)

	* Ported to Fedora Core 3, SUSE Enterprise Linux 9.
	* Support new gcc 3.4 .bbg and .da format (actually 2 formats each,
	bigendian and littleendian).
	* First attempt at supporting the file format generated by gcc 3.3.3
	on Mandrake 10.x.
	* Add a new window to ggcov to show a Lego diagram.
	* Added a simple PHP web interface for navigating coverage data
	* Add a second package ggcov-web and package all the web bits there.
	* Scan executables to find required shared libraries, and recursively
	scan shared libraries to find their required libraries, and scan
	all of those for coveraged source.
	* Added --solve-fuzzy flag to ggcov, tggcov and ggcov-webdb to ignore
	inconsistencies in arc counts on a per-function basis.  Useful for
	samples from kernel coverage on multiprocessor machines.
	* Hide the Arc column in the Calls window by default, to match the
	initial state of the check menu item.
	* When scanning object files for calls, don't record magic calls
	to __cxa_throw() et al that g++ inserts.
	* In the Calls window, don't show calls from blocks that have no
	source associated with them; this hides the magic calls to
	__cxa_throw() et al that g++ inserts.
	* cov_arc_t::finalise() suppresses arcs which are calls to any of
	the g++ internal exception handling functions like __cxa_throw().
	* Handle PIC code relocs when scanning objects to build the callgraph.
	* Grey out the View buttons on the Calls window when appropriate.
	* Package the tggcov executable
	* Small improvement to the formatting of block listings in the Source window.
	* Icon looks marginally prettier

	* Convert cov_function_t::list_all() to use the templated C++
	list wrapper
	* Added status() method to cov_block_t, cov_arc_t, cov_function_t,
	cov_file_t.  Calls calc_stats().
	* portability: use /usr/bin/env to find bash for shell scripts
	* Abstract differences between GTK1 and GTK2 ways of setting tree/list
	column visibility into ui_list_set_column_visibility().
	* Centralise two copies of nearly identical code to populate a combobox
	with names of functions.
	* Check for gnome_program_init() in -lgnome-2 as well as -lgnome.
	* Calculate the GUIPROG variable in configure instead of Makefile.am
	* Moved the status_t enum from class cov_line_t to a new global class cov.
	* Converted low-level cov file IO code to C++, mostly to enable
	run-time switching between bigendian and littleendian via C++
	virtual functions, for the gcc 3.4 format.
	* Replace Lego and Callgraph windows with a unified Diagram window which
	uses the diagram_t abstraction.  No user-visible differences.
	* Change from gnome_config_*() API to gconf, when detected by autoconf
	* Added a schema file for gconf.
	* ggcov.desktop no longer needs full path to icon
	* Drop -Wmissing-prototypes as gcc3.4 complains when given it in C++ mode
	* Added --without-bfd configure option to make life easier for the PLD guys.
	* Combine GTK1 and GTK2 functions for getting double-click data.
	* Check whether the old gtk1.2 automake macros exist before using them
	* Rationalised icon formats: PNG to install. XPM to #include
	* Detect the name of the raw size field in bfd's asection struct, as it changed.
	* Removed unnecessary #includes of covio.h
	* Also remove configure for the buildrpm --force option.
	* Make finalise() calls descend all the way to cov_arc_t level.
	* Use EXTRA_PROGRAMS so the source tarball builds properly

	* In tests, when comparing tggcov output vs expected, filter out
	line counts for the { and } lines at the start & end of functions.
	* Test code handles slightly different text output from gcov
	* Test feature: if $RPLATFORM is set when running tests, use all
	the compiled programs, .bbg and .da files from a remote platform.
	* runtest doesn't use a logfile anymore
	* Added --disable-gui configure option to allow for headless testing
	* Added test for coveraged code in shared libraries.
	* portability fixes to enable platform.sh to work on Solaris
	* Added support for using the standard automake "check" target.
	* reordered platform string to put version last
	* Add the test/ hierarchy to the source tarball.

	* Fix a memory leak in the scanning of object files.
	* Portability fix: on some platforms, getc() and ungetc() are macros.
	  Rename member functions of cpp_parser_t to avoid trouble.
	* In configure, calculate variables CPU_DEFINES and OS_DEFINES
	  to enable CPU-specific and OS-specific code respectively.
	  Doesn't support cross-compile.
	* valgrind-run supports valgrind version 2.
	* Fix the dist: target yet again.
	* Fix bug where estring::truncate_to() could not handle a new
	length longer than the old length.
	* Fix bug where expanding an estring by a large amount fails
	to allocate enough space and overruns the buffer.
	* Add append_vprintf(), insert_vprintf() and replace_vprintf() to estring.
	* Fix UMR in estring const constructor.



Sun Sep 26 20:48:49 2004  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.3

	* Added a number of text reports to ggcov, tggcov.
	* Added -o option to ggcov, tggcov (same as gcov's -o option).
	* Summary window shows percentages of partially covered entities.
	* Split Summary window numeric display into separate columns for
	proportion and percentage, to get better visual alignment.
	* Added Blocks column to the Functions window.
	* Added Blocks and Functions columns to the Files window.
	* Added support for yet another .bbg/.bb/.da file format, this time
	emitted by gcc 3.3.2 in Fedora Core 1.

	* Source lines which depend on any of the cpp symbols in the
	suppression set, are suppressed.  The -X commandline option
	* adds a cpp symbol to the suppression set.
	* Arcs from suppressed lines are suppressed; functions are
	suppressed if they contain no unsuppressed lines.
	* Suppressed source lines are shown in a different colour.

	* Reorganised BFD and platform-specific call scanning code.
	* Various minor bug fixes.
	* Checked in a bunch of tests which have been sitting around.

Tue Nov  4 23:55:52 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.2.2

	* Added simple man page to document commandline usage.
	* Fixed bug where callgraph scanning found no calls ever.
	* Replaced most #ifdef DEBUG debugging prints with runtime prints.
	with commandline selection of debug features.

Sun Aug  3 18:37:40 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.2.1

	* Fixed bug where stabs32 filename scanning code was never linked in,
	so ggcov couldn't be given an executable as an argument.
	* Added a warning when configure falls back from GNOME v2 to v1.2.
	* configure check for the popt library works on platforms where
	libpopt.so is not in /usr/lib but in the same nonstandard
	location as the GNOME libraries.
	* Removed acconfig.h.  We can do without it on autoconf 2.13 and it
	makes autoconf 2.57 whine mightily.

Tue Jul 22 21:43:30 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.2

	* Full support for all features in GTK2.
	* Removed the --enable-gtk2 configure option; uses GTK 2.0 if
	its installed and recent enough otherwise fallback to GTK 1.2.
	* Fixed colour coding of list rows in Files and Functions windows
	in gtk2.
	* Pushed ifdef code for dealing with GtkText in gtk 1.2 build versus
	GtkTextView in gtk 2.0, down into new ui_text_*() functions.  Source
	and Licence windows use new ui_text_*() functions.  No GTK2 ifdefs.
	* Fixed compile warning in GTK2 port.

	* Added GNOME .desktop file (thanks to Dag Wieers) and a 63x63
	desktop icon.
	* ggcov handles file:// URLs on the command line so it can be
	invoked by dragging files or directories from Nautilus
	onto its GNOME desktop icon.
	* Default action if no files on commandline (e.g. user double-clicks
	the desktop icon) is to show the File->Open dialog and exit if files
	are selected (used to be the same as "ggcov .").

	* User can load source, objects or directories into ggcov by dragging
	and dropping them from Nautilus.
	* Added File->Open dialog to allow user to select executables, source
	files or directories.  Files can be loaded in multiple passes, e.g.
	from multiple invocations of the File->Open dialog.
	* Added MVC module.
	* Class cov_file_t provides an object to be listened to for MVC
	notifications of when the global set of files changes.
	* All windows are notified of changes to the global files set
	by having their populate() method called, which rebuilds the
	display from scratch.

    	* Added support for building RPMs on RedHat 9.
	* Support for autoconf 2.57 (RH9).
	* Fixed library order bug which broke build on RH9.
	* Encode into the RPM filename the name of the Linux distro where built.
	* Only one of the two glade files is packaged into the RPM.
	* Used %configure in spec file.  Required switching from
	overloading prefix to DESTDIR in %install stage.

	* Added ptrarray_t, a templated wrapper around glib's GPtrArray.
	* Converted most uses of GPtrArray to ptrarray_t.

	* Reorganised data structures.  There is now a per-line class
	cov_line_t, an array of which is kept per-file.  It contains the list
	of blocks for that line as well as caching the calculated count.
	* cov_file_t now created on demand for secondary files, e.g. header
	files with inline functions.

	* Fixed bug which failed an assert if user selected a range of
	uninstrumented lines in the Source window and used the Summarise Range
	command.
	* Fixed bugs with text window line selection in gtk2 port.
	* Removed spurious #ifdef which was always disabling the config file.
	* Made formatting in Source window a little less dependent on hardcoded
	column widths.
	* Removed last traces of the screenshot_mode option.
	* Fixed bug where Files window's populate() method didn't handle
	being called twice.
	* Added argv0 so test programs will link.

Fri Jul 11 01:51:32 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.8

	* Fixed interpretation of relative filenames in .bb files.
	* Added assignment operators to class estring.
	* Fixed broken compile when libbfd missing.
	* When showing or hiding columns in the Source window, preserve
	the scroll position instead of flipping back to the start.

Wed Jul  2 22:30:45 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.7

	* Fixed bug in detection of gcc 2.96 braindamage which spuriously
	triggered the error message on gcc 3.3.
	* Fixed bug where Source window wrap was disabled for the GTK2 build
	even when it didn't need to be.
	* Enabled the Source window File->Save As command for gtk2 build, which
	also removes some runtime warnings when the Source window is opened.
	* Captured the log output for a new GTK2 log domain.
	* Simplified log initialisation code.

Wed Jul  2 22:30:45 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.6

	* Initial support for new gcc 3.3 bbg and da formats.
	* Make cov_file_t::read_bbg_function() more robust in the face
	of bad data (e.g. the new .bbg file format).
	* Added support for moving machine-specific code into subclasses
	of abstract generic classes, including a factory class.  Moved the
	stab32 parsing code into a machine-specific subclass.
	* Updated strings to mention ggcov not cant.
	* Improved debugging prints.
	* Reorganised Makefile to build two archive libraries and link ggcov
	and test programs from there, rather than specifying all the source
	for every test program.
	* Added test program newbbgdump to dump the new gcc 3.3 bbg format.
	* Added test program tggcov to write coveraged like gcov, for automated
	comparison of basic block accounting.
	* Moved the summarise() debug code to cov.C:cov_dump().
	* Fixed FMR while parsing arguments in gtk1.2 build.
	* Fixed unused variable warning in argument parsing.
	* Fixed compile bug in debug message in fileswin.C.
	* Fixed bug in declarations of describe() methods in subclasses
	of cov_scope_t which only showed up in high debug levels.
	* Strip '&' as well as '*' when normalising mangled .bbg names.

Sat Jun 14 00:22:17 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.5

	* Autoconf detects presence of gtk_text_buffer_select_range() and handles
	its absence as gracefully as possible.
	* If libpopt is missing, supply our own trivial implementation.  This allows
	only parse_args() to exist while handling building on systems with gtk2
	and no libpopt.
	* Fixed a couple of bugs gtk2 in the Source window where selecting items
	from the Filename or function menus would SEGV.

Sun Jun  8 16:23:01 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.4

	* Made ggcov more robust when faced with problems finding or loading
	data from object files; emits warning messages and keeps going rather
	than failing asserts.
	* Recognise file extensions .cc .cxx and .cpp as source code.
	* Added a wrapper for the C++ demangling code in libiberty and a
	function to normalise mangled names.
	* Demangle names from .o files, normalise mangled names from .bb files.
	* Ggcov doesn't use the "fake" arc flag from the .bbg data file anymore
	but detects call arcs using the arc's destination block.  With a
	working gcc this makes no difference; with the braindead 2.96 ggcov
	can detect most rather than none of the call arcs.
	* Ggcov now detects broken data files written by braindead gcc 2.96,
	and emits a warning message and skips reading the object file.
	* Ggcov will search directories for source files recursively;  disabled
	by default, enabled with the --recursive/-r option.
	* cov_file_t and related objects can be deleted, correctly & efficiently.
	Needed for directory scanning to be robust in the presence of source
	which isn't compiled, or is compiled but not linked.

	* Added hashtable_t templated wrapper for GHashTable, and replaced
	all uses of GHashTable with the wrapper.
	* Functions window can use a typesafe list now.
	* Replaced all uses of the strassign() & strdelete() macros with
	class string_var.
	* Fileswin uses tok_t tokenizer instead of strtok().
	* Added operator to cast estring to const char*.
	* Minor de-crufting.

	* Created a cov_scope_t class which abstracts the scoped statistics
	summary.  Moved the overall and range scope code from global functions
	into private members of derived classes of cov_scope_t.
	* Call Graph window uses scope objects instead of calling calc_stats().
	* Added cov_compound_scope_t for aggregating multiple scopes, cached.
	* Files window and functions window use scope objects instead of
	calling calc_stats() methods and caching the results.
	* cov_file_t::calc_stats() and cov_function_t::calc_stats() are now
	private; they are only needed by the scope objects, which are friends.

	* Fixed bug where double-click in Files List window didn't work.
	* Fixed memleak in the Call Graph window.
	* Fixed argument parsing code.
	* Fixed memleak destroying cov_blocks during recursive source scan.
	* Fixed bug in debug output.
	* Fixed broken view menu checkboxes in gtk2 build.
	* Fixed many bugs with gtk2 port.  Most windows now work passably
	rather than coredump when first shown.
	* Simplified coding of list & tree double-click handlers, also hides
	most of the gtk/gtk2 differences.

Sat May 31 17:32:17 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.3

	* Fixed bug in string_var class which randomly broke data file loading.
	* Removed warnings in -DDEBUG build.

Fri May 30 00:56:06 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.2

	* Added title column buttons to source window, and a View menu item
	to hide them.
	* Reimplemented Files window's tree mode; now shows accumulated statistics
	on directories.
	* Added a menu item to the Source window to save the source with the
	currently selected annotations.
	* All directories mentioned on the commandline are searched for
	all .bb .bbg .da and .o files, in the given order and always
	starting with the source file's own directory.  This gives the
	functionality of "gcov -o".
	* Rewrote file_make_absolute() to normalise out "." and ".." from
	pathnames.
	* Removed a stray TAB from a GUI label.
	* Centralised the File->Close and File->Exit callbacks in class window_t.
	* Added string_var and tok_t classes for string manipulation.
	* Portability fixes.
	* Minor code cleanups.

Mon Mar 17 14:54:46 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1.1
	
	* Added a tree mode to Files window, which displays source files
	from multiple directories in a tree format.
	* When the Call Butterfly window is shown, initialise the hpaned widget
	so that both the Calls From and Calls To lists are visible.
	* Call Graph window shows whole graph when graph is nontrivial.
	Layout algorithm still sucks.
	* Hacked around bug with new argument parsing where gtk/gnome options
	are not stripped out before ggcov parses the arguments.
	* Fixed bug which lost list column header labels on recent gtk 1.2's.
	* Fixed bugs where Call Graph window would SEGV or loop when the
	coverage data contained function call loops.

Tue Mar 11 13:54:45 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.1

	* Compile ggcov with the C++ compiler.
	* Converted cov.[ch] to C++, split up into multiple source files.
	* Added base class window_t and converted all the GUI windows to be
	derived classes of window_t.
	* Converted estring to C++.
	* Added C++ list_t<> templated wrapper for GList.
	* Added list_t::sort().
	* Moved ggcov.c:read_gcov_directory() -> cov.c:cov_read_directory().
	* In many different places the internals details of how cov_file_t's,
	cov_function_t's, and cov_block_t's are related was unnecessarily
	exposed.  Added cov_file_num_functions(), cov_function_num_blocks();
	enforced use of cov_file_nth_function() & cov_function_nth_block().
	* Separated cov_callnode_t and cov_callarc_t into their own files
	and converted them to C++.
	* cov_get_count_by_location() returns a 4-way enum instead of
	of a boolean, indicating the coverage status of the line.  One
	of the enum values indicates partially covered lines, i.e. multiple
	blocks appear on the line and not all of them are executed.
	* Renamed sourcewin_t::show_file() to show_filename() and added a new
	show_file() which takes a cov_file_t.  Summarywin and fileswin use
	the new function.
	* Converted fileswin.C:file_rec_t to C++.
	* Provided global operator delete which provides no value except
	to shut up valgrind and Purify about mismatched frees.
	* C++ compiler noticed that mode_t is unsigned so returning -1 through
	it is a bug...so changed return type of file_mode() to int.
	* Converted sourcewin.C:sourcewin_hacky_rec_t to C++.
	* Removed the global filenames list and replaced with a list of
	cov_file_t's iterated by cov_file_t::first().
	* Converted functionswin.C:func_rec_t to C++.
	* Extended file_change_extension() to allow the old extension to be
	specified as NULL which uses any existing extension.

	* Uses c99's uint64_t where available.
	* Centralised definitions of unsigned 32 & 64 bit ints.
	* Provided macros in covio.h for formatting covio_u{32,64}_t.
	* Added define COV_COUNT_MAX which is maximum value of a count_t.
	* Centralised 64-bit integer printf format strings.

	* Partial gtk2 port derived from code contributed by Havoc Pennington.
	* GNOME colour pickers disabled for gtk2.
	* Canvas-based call graph window disabled for gtk2.
	* Config file reading disabled for gtk2.
	* Removed useless --glade-path option.

	* Added cov_is_source_filename() to test whether a filename matches
	the known source file extensions.
	* Renamed cov_handle_c_file() -> cov_read_source_file().
	* Added cov_read_object_file() which uses the .stab and .stabstr
	ELF sections to extract a list of source filenames with full paths.
	* Added cov_pre_read() by analogy with cov_post_read(); will be
	useful one day.

	* Added infrastructure for program preferences, saved and loaded
	using gnome_config_*() routines.
	* Added preferences dialog to edit preferences.
	* Added to prefs foreground and background colours for colour coding
	various items according to coverage status.
	* Tweaked some default colours for better look.
	* Summarywin uses colours from prefs.
	* Functionswin colour codes list entries using colours from prefs.
	* Fileswin colour codes list entries using colours from prefs.
	* Sourcewin uses colours from prefs.
	* Callgraph2win uses colours from prefs.

	* Added a second Call Graph window which actually has a graphical
	presentation rather than navigable distribution to callers/callees.
	New window present calls as nodes in a call graph, with function
	name, filename, and coverage show textually in the node.  Nodes
	are colour coded red, yellow or green according to the function's
	line coverage.  Nodes with no instrumented source lines are grey.
	Arcs are colour coded according to arc coverage.  Layout is fixed
	and very primitive.
	* Changed the Windows menu names of the two call graph windows
	to be more indicative and less ambiguous: callgraphwin announces
	itself as "Call Butterfly" and callgraph2win as "Call Graph".
	* Attempted to improve the call graph window layout algorithm.

	* Callgraphwin list frame labels are easier to understand, e.g.
	"Called from" instead of "Distribution to Ancestors".
	* Sourcewin's block column collapses runs of consecutive blocks into
	a range, e.g. "3-6" instead of "3,4,5,6".  Avoids a lot of column
	overflow.
	* Split Function combo box into From Function and To Function boxes,
	both of which have an "All Functions" wildcard item which is the
	default.
	* Reorganised columns in Calls window, now has From To Line Arc Count.
	* Moved list of filenames and functions in source window from menubar
	to a new toolbar.
	* Added View->Toolbar to the source window to control whether the toolbar
	is visible (visible by default).
	* Added to prefs a boolean controlling whether a new source window is
	popped up every time or an old one is reused.
	* Added preference to reuse the summary window.
	* Added concept of minimal file names, where only the minimal
	unique suffix of a filename is displayed to the user.
	* Double-clicking on a row in the Calls list shows the `from' source line.
	* Visual improvements to the About window.
	* Added View menu to Calls window with a check menu item for each
	column.  Arc column is off by default.
	* Added icon for all toplevel windows derived from logo.xpm.
	* Added ui.c infrastructure for app to select a default icon.
	* Added infrastructure to debug GTK/Glib log messages.
	* Added to source window menu items to summarise the source file,
	the selected function, or the selected source lines.

	* window_t::show() will also raise a window.
	* Reduce unnecessary processing on windows that are reused by only
	calling populate() the first time a window is shown.
	* Added default definitions of _ and N_ in preparation for gettext.
	* Dealt with stupid gnome header files redefining _ and N_.
	* Made cov_function_t::name() const like it always should have been.

	* Adding version.m4 for the website.
	* Used aclocal.m4 the way it was intended.
	* Install & distribute the logo pixmap.
	* Removed autoconf stuff from .spec file setup section.
	* For gcc, add a bunch of warning options to $CFLAGS.
	* Added bbdump program to help debug .bb file problems.
	* Ignored a couple more generated files.
	* The .cvsignore and .gdbinit files are distributed.
	* Various minor configure.in/Makefile.am updates from Havoc Pennington.

	* Fixed bug which SEGVd when double-clicking on a function in the
	functions window which has no executable lines.
	* Fixed buffer overrun bug in sourcewin due to my misunderstanding
	the return value of snprintf().
	* Fixed bug which incorrectly assumed that the last function listed in
	the coverage data file would contain the last source line in its source
	file.  Now keep an explicit last location variable.
	* Fixed bug found by valgrind where selecting the last line of
	a source window overran the offsets_by_line_ array.
	* Fixed bug where sourcewin_t::show_lines() didn't show the window.
	* Worked around a bug where cov_arc_get_from_location()
	sometimes returned 0 unexpectedly.

	* Removed superfluous include of estring.h
	* Added estring_replace_all() instead of the poorly implemented
	attempt in ui.c.
	* Fixed minor warnings.
	* Made some debugging prints appear less frequently.
	* Removed some asserts from list_t dtor, valgrind is a better
	debugging tool.

Mon Dec  3 12:07:12 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.7.

	* Builds a callgraph from the information read from various files,
	including calls to functions not covered (like printf).
	* Added a window to explore the call graph.  Shows distribution to
	callers and callees in clists; double-clicking navigates to the
	new function.
	* Added a Calls window which shows the call coverage per-call
	for a given function.
	* Ggcov uses the BFD library to read object files, using relocs,
	contents and symbols for text sections to figure out names
	for function call arcs in the block graph.
	* Added option to Source window to show block numbers.
	* Added ulcmp() and ullcmp() to help sorting on unsigned longs
	and unsigned long longs respectively.
	* Renamed xmalloc() -> gnb_xmalloc() to avoid possible clash
	with function of same name in -liberty.
	* Added ui_combo_set_current_data().
	* Added listclear() macro which deletes GList structures like listdelete()
	but does not call any dtor.
	* Fixed a few minor problems with debugging prints and warnings.

Fri Nov 30 12:26:55 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.6
	* Added a Files List window analagous to the Function List window.
	* Added fixed Windows menu items to create new Summary, Source, File
	List and Function List windows.
	* Initial window population is now just an overall summary.
	* Sortable column support now handles the case where not every column
	is sortable (backport from ggui).
	* Added a TODO list of some ideas.

Tue Nov 27 11:53:14 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.5
	* Added progress bars to show test coverage stats in the Summary window.
	* Progress bars display red/green to color code coverage stats.
	Had to subclass from GtkProgressBar to achieve this.
	* Added a Functions List window to show all the functions in all
	the files, with line call and branch coverage results.  Clicking
	on columns sorts the list by that column.  Double-clicking on
	rows shows the source for that function.
	* Added support for having an up or down arrow in the current sort
	column of a clist.  Clicking on the columns does the expected
	thing with sorting.

Sun Nov 25 19:44:38 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.4
	* Added GUI to show summary of coverage statistics at
	overall, file, function, and range scope.
	* Various small GUI improvments.

Sat Nov 24 01:34:43 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.3
	* Added GUI to browse source annotated with line execution
	counts (only).
    	* Built RPM.

Fri Nov 23 15:41:28 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>

	* Release 0.0.2
	* Split source code up from one big .c file.
	* First check into CVS.
