.SH NAME
ggcov \- a GNOME frontend for exploring gcov coverage data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBggcov\fP [\fIGNOME options\fP] 
[[\fB\-r\fP] \fIdirectory\fP|\fIfile\fP] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBGgcov\fP is a GTK+ GUI for exploring test coverage data produced by
C and C++ programs compiled with \fIgcc \-fprofile-arcs \-ftest-coverage\fP.
So it's basically a GUI replacement for the \fBgcov\fP program that comes
with \fBgcc\fP.
.PP
\fBGgcov\fP understands all the standard GTK+ and GNOME options, such
as \fB\-display\fP.  Most other options are used to specify how to find
and handle coverage data files.  The arguments can combinations of:
.IP \fIdirectory\fP
The directory is scanned for source files, which are handled as if they
had been specified on the commandline (except that missing coverage
data files are silently ignored).  If the \fB\-r\fP flag is in effect,
sub\-directories are scanned recursively.  Multiple directories can
be specified and are scanned in the order given.
.IP \fIexecutable\fP
The executable file is scanned for debugging records which contain
source file names, and each source file which exists is handled as if
it had been specified on the command line (except that missing coverage
data files are silently ignored).  Any shared libraries on which the
executable depends are also scanned.  Multiple executables can
be specified and are scanned in the order given.  This feature is
only available on some platforms (for example, i386-linux).
.IP \fIsource-file\fP
Is any regular file ending in one of the file extensions \fI.c\fP,
\fI.cc\fP, \fI.cxx\fP, \fI.cpp\fP, or \fI.C\fP.  Source files are
matched to their corresponding coverage data files (\fI.gcno\fP and
\fI.gcda\fP files) and object files by searching for a file of the same
basename and the appropriate extension first in the same directory
as the source file and then in all the directories specified on the
command line (in the order they were specified).
.PP
If no arguments are given, \fBggcov\fP shows a file selection
dialog so you can select one directory, executable, or source file.
.PP
Directories, executables, or source files can also be added after
\fBggcov\fP is started by dragging and dropping them from a GNOME
Nautilus window onto any \fBggcov\fP window.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIdir\fP, \fB\-\-object\-directory\fP=\fIdir\fP
Add the directory \fIdir\fP to the search path for object
files and coverage data files.
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIdir\fP, \fB\-\-gcda\-prefix\fP=\fIdir\fP
Look for runtime coverage data files (\fI.gcda\fP files) underneath the
directory \fIdir\fP instead of next to the corresponding \fI.c\fP files.
See the example in the \fBggcov-run\fP(1) manpage.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-recursive\fP
When a directory is specified on the command line, search for
coverage data files recursively in all child directories.

.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIwindows\fP, \fB\-\-initial\-windows\fP=\fIwindows\fP
Open the named windows when \fBggcov\fP starts.  One or more
window names may be given, separated by commas or whitespace.
Defined window names
are \fIsummary\fP, \fIfiles\fP, \fIfunctions\fP, \fIcalls\fP,
\fIcallbutterfly\fP, \fIcallgraph\fP, \fIlego\fP, \fIsource\fP,
and \fIreports\fP.  The default window is \fIsummary\fP.

.TP
\fB\-X\fP \fIsymbols\fP, \fB\-\-suppress\-ifdef=\fP\fIsymbols\fP
Suppress code inside C pre-processor directives which depend on
any of the given \fIsymbols\fP.  Suppressed code is not included
in statistics or summaries.  One or
more symbols may be given, separated by commas or whitespace.  \fBGgcov\fP
understands the following subset of the C pre-processor command set:
.IP
\(bu \fI#if SYMBOL\fP
.br
\(bu \fI#if defined(SYMBOL)\fP
.br
\(bu \fI#ifdef SYMBOL\fP
.br
\(bu \fI#ifndef SYMBOL\fP
.br
\(bu \fI#else\fP
.br
\(bu \fI#endif\fP
.br
.IP
For example, \fB-X DEBUG\fP will suppress the \fIfprintf()\fP call in this code:
.IP
.nf
unsigned int
my_function(unsigned int x)
{
    x += 42;
#ifdef DEBUG
    fprintf(stderr, "my_function: x=%u\\n", x);
#endif
    return x;
}
.fi
.IP
This option is useful for suppressing test infrastructure code, debugging
code, or other code which is compiled into the coverage test executable
but whose coverage is not significant.

.TP
\fB\-Y\fP \fIwords\fP, \fB\-\-suppress\-comment=\fP\fIwords\fP
Suppress code on lines which also contain a single-line comment
comprising only one of the given \fIwords\fP.  Suppressed code is
not included in statistics or summaries.  One or more symbols may be
given, separated by commas or whitespace.  For example,
specifying \fB-Y IGNOREME\fP will suppress the \fIassert()\fP in this code:
.IP
.nf
unsigned int
my_function(unsigned int x)
{
    x += 42;
    assert(x >= 42);   /* IGNOREME */
    return x;
}
.fi
.IP
This option is useful for suppressing test infrastructure code, debugging
code, or other code which is compiled into the coverage test executable
but whose coverage is not significant.

.TP
\fB\-Z\fP \fIstartword,endword,...\fP \fB\-\-suppress\-comment-between=\fP\fIstartword,endword,...\fP
Suppress code on lines between those containing a single-line comment
comprising only \fIstartword\fP and the next single-line comment comprising
only \fIendword\fP.  Suppressed code is not included in statistics or summaries.
Two or more symbols may be given, in pairs, separated by commas or
whitespace.  For example, \fB-Z STARTIGNORE,ENDIGNORE\fP
will suppress the entire function in this code:
.IP
.nf
/* STARTIGNORE */
unsigned int
my_function(unsigned int x)
{
    x += 42;
    return x;
}
// ENDIGNORE
.fi
.IP
This option is useful for suppressing test infrastructure code, debugging
code, or other code which is compiled into the coverage test executable
but whose coverage is not significant.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
View coverage data for all the available source in an executable (on
some platforms only):
.IP
.B ggcov a.out
.PP
View coverage data for all the C source in the current directory,
suppressing code which depends on the symbols \fBDEBUG\fP or
\fBTEST\fP:
.IP
.B ggcov -X DEBUG,TEST *.c
.PP
View coverage data for all the C source in one directory where the
object files and test coverage data files are in different directories:
.IP
.B ggcov /foo/obj/ /foo/cov\-data/ /foo/src/
